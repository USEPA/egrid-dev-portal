# Design Elements

Specific guidance about common visualization characteristics and components.

Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever they see.

### Color

We should aim to make visualizations usable by all by maintaining 508 compliance and adhering to access and equity principles. This means meeting audiences where they are in terms of accessing the data, for example by ensuring that visualizations can be read by screen readers, providing data tables to support charts where possible, and standardizing chart types and interaction methods to ensure navigating these data products is easy and familiar.

### Typography

Visualizations should be easy to interpret by the general public. To support this tenet, visualizations should engage with surrounding page content in a meaningful way: they should demonstrate an evident purpose and be helpful to understanding the topic at hand. For instance, we should avoid creating charts just for the sake of adding visuals to a page.

### Symbology

The design and styling of charts and visualizations should be consistent and standardizedacross products, pages, and sites. The benefits of this approach are threefold: first, it helps users navigate across multiple offerings in a familiar without having to relearn the semantics of each new product. Second, it provides guiderails for visualization as they develop new charts and products. Last, consistency supports trust in the EPA through adherence to US government and internal standards.

### Chart Layout

Interactivity is a powerful enhancement to web-based content that should be employed thoughtfully: use it to provide context or supplementary information while reducing chart clutter. Avoid using interactivity to reveal crucial information about a chart that should be present by default. Visualizations should also be responsive across a variety of screen types (including phones, tablets, and PCs), audience capabilities (including low literacy groups or non-native English speakers), and presentation methods (including the use of static vs interactive charts).
