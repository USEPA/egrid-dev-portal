# Charts

Specific guidance about common chart types and subtypes.

## Charts

There are two common approaches to choosing the right chart. One is to focus on the kind of underlying data you have: are you working with quantitative or categorical values? Are you representing absolute values or changes within a value? The other is to focus on the story you’re trying to tell with the data, or the insights you want people to walk away with: Are you trying to emphasize a change? Are you trying to compare two groups to each other or to a third value? In this guide, we focus on the second method, by starting with the “purpose” of a chart.

### Examining Proportions
## Area Charts
Area charts can impart an overall sense of changing proportions; use them if the exact values of each category are less important than the composition of the whole and how the combination changes over time.

## Bar and Column Charts
Bar and column charts are useful when you have data you want to compare across categories on a nominal or ordinal scale or have time-based, discrete data.

## Stacked Bar and Column Charts
Stacked bar and column charts are most helpful when comparing multiple subcategories to their respective category totals. They’re less helpful if you need to make comparisons between individual subcategories.

## Tree Maps
Tree maps are good for communicating hierarchy as well as proportions, though it is sometimes difficult to make exact comparisons between sizes of rectangles if they vary in both width and height. Tree maps may take some getting used to for users.

### Making Comparisons
## Bar and Column Charts
Bar and column charts are useful when you have data you want to compare across categories on a nominal or ordinal scale or have time-based, discrete data.

## Grouped Bar and Column Charts
Grouped bar and column charts are useful when each category has subcategories and you need to be able to easily compare between subcategories.

## Parallel Plots
Parallel plots show how categories compare across a variety of metrics, sometimes of different ranges and units. They are also helpful in revealing potential correlations between those metrics within or across categories.

### Highlighting One Value
## Data Tables
If you have a lot of data and you want users to be able to search for and find specific values in it, data tables offer a more efficient approach than visualizations. If you format your table well, it can also facilitate comparisons between individual values.

## KPIs
Using a visually noticeable, text-based representation for the number you want audiences to focus on sometimes works better than producing an entire visual.

### Exploring Correlations
## Bubble Charts
Bubble charts show correlations like scatterplots do, with the added benefit of encoding an additional metric in the size of the points (turning them into bubbles). Always scale the size of a bubble’s area, not radius, relative to the encoded value.

## Heatmaps
Heatmaps are less precise than things like bar charts, but better for producing high-density charts—charts when you need to communicate a lot of information quickly.

## Parallel Plots
Parallel plots show how categories compare across a variety of metrics, sometimes of different ranges and units. They are also helpful in revealing potential correlations between those metrics within or across categories.

## Scatterplots
Scatterplots are useful to show potential correlations—and their directions and magnitudes—across individual data points. Adding lines of best fit can help make those things clearer.

### Tracking Changes Over Time
## Area Charts
Area charts can impart an overall sense of changing proportions; use them if the exact values of each category are less important than the composition of the whole and how the combination changes over time.

## Line Charts
Line charts are useful when you want to show trends in continuous, quantitative data over time.

## Sparklines
Sparklines are best used to show general trends and at-a-glance patterns, not specific values. They work well in tables or in visualizations that are information-dense.

### Highlighting Geographic Data
## Bubble Maps
Bubble maps are best for showing amounts in addition to specific, point-based locations. They’re also good for visualizing information about absolute numbers (often people).

## Choropleth Maps
Choropleth maps are best when your data can be normalized and aggregated up to a common geographic boundary, such as counties or states. The focus is on how a variable affects place.

## Icon Maps
Icon maps provide an extra layer of specificity to maps highlighting point-based locations. Icons should be used to represent categories, not quantities.
