Specific guidance about common chart types and subtypes.

## Charts

There are two common approaches to choosing the right chart. One is to focus on the kind of underlying data you have: are you working with quantitative or categorical values? Are you representing absolute values or changes within a value? The other is to focus on the story you’re trying to tell with the data, or the insights you want people to walk away with: Are you trying to emphasize a change? Are you trying to compare two groups to each other or to a third value? In this guide, we focus on the second method, by starting with the “purpose” of a chart.
